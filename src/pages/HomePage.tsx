          <Card.Title>How It All Started</Card.Title>
          <p className="max_lg:my-1">
            It all started when I discovered that my high school offered
            programming courses. I was immediately intrigued by the potential of
            coding to solve problems. I knew that I wanted to learn more and
            that I had a passion for technology. So, I enrolled in a class.
          </p>

          <p className="max_lg:my-1">
            Starting with the Basic programming language in DOS, I was able to
            grasp the fundamentals of coding. After that, I moved on to C++ and
            Pascal. By the end of the first year I had a solid understanding of
            programming and was starting to teach the teacher new things. I knew
            that this was my calling and that it came naturally to me.
          </p>

          <p className="max_lg:my-1">
            I would spend hours in the back of the book store, reading books and
            magazines about the languages I was learning; and other languages
            that interested me, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p className="max_lg:my-1">
            When I was finally able to drive and get my first job, I was hired
            by a small, local dial-up internet provider as a technical support
            representative. It wasn&apos;t a position that involved programming,
            but it involved computer technology. During that time, I continued
            to learn more about computer systems and hone my programming skills.
            Eventually, that lead to a job at a local company that designed and
            manufactured touch screen kiosks. We used some software that was
            sufficient for basic functionality, but we wanted to try some more
            complicated applications and the software wasn&apos;t up to the
            task. So I saw an opportunity to put my skills to use and got busy.
