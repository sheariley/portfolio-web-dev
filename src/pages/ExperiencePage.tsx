                  <li>
                    Continued work on previous dashboard framework and
                    architecture to support new data-driven visualization
                    widgets including gauges, charts, and maps.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Worked with the BI team to design and implement a number of
                    new data-driven visualization widgets, including
                    cartesian-style graphs and charts, geographical and numeric
                    heatmaps, gauges, and expression-based card carousel. The
                    dashboard framework and widgets are tailored to drive the
                    discovery of insights relating to retail marketing and
                    distribution.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented an expression-based action command
                    framework to facilitate the building of customizable,
                    interactive dashboard experience for customers and
                    employees. This allowed widgets to link to reports and other
                    dashboards, creating a pathway for drill-downs and dynamic
                    filtering.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented a web-based visual dashboard
                    designer that enabled users to build dashboards for the
                    newly developed framework.

                  <li>
                    Appointed to roles of front-end architect, product owner,
                    and lead engineer of a team tasked with continuing the
                    development of a new front-end framework and component-set
                    (with documentation) for rapidly building new applications
                    and modernizing existing applications. This framework and
                    component-set was based on a “skunk-works” project I started
                    on my own initiative after experiencing and observing the
                    pains and inhibitions of an antiquated architecture with a
                    large amount of technical debt. The framework was based on
                    Angular and Angular Material with emphasis on not
                    re-creating the wheel and only attempting to fill the gaps
                    of functionality that were required by our planned
                    applications. This involved either implementing the
                    components in-house, or integrating existing open-source and
                    paid third-party components using the integration facilities
                    of our new framework.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented a multi-layered containerized
                    development environment for Angular front-end applications,
                    using Docker on WSL2. The container was designed to create a
                    consistent environment for all front-end developers and to
                    reduce the onboarding time for new developers. The
                    containerized environment was also used along with Azure
                    Pipelines to build and deploy the container image to test
                    and production environments.

                <h4>Role: Canopy Team - Front-end Software Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                  I was selected to be a part of the R&D team that developed new
                  products including Canopy, an advanced analytics platform for
                  online retail which also served as a comprehensive tool for
                  clients to manage their online presence.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Skills used:</strong> Angular 5, RxJS, NGRX,
                    Highcharts, Reactive and Functional programming, Single
                    Store pattern, .NET Core Framework, C#, ASP.NET Core Web
                    API, Entity Framework Core, Node.js/NPM, WebPack, Angular
                    CLI, Angular Material UI Framework, and SASS/CSS.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed new and improved performance of analytics
                    dashboard components, including various data visualizations.
                    This required working closely with the BI engineers to
                    accommodate the various types of online retail analytics.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented UI/UX for user input of post-run
                    data filtering for chart visualization. This filtering was
                    applied after the content job had been processed and thus
                    was very fast and efficient, and allowed the user to quickly
                    and easily manipulate the visualizations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Worked with the team to develop a set of components and APIs
                    for assembling client-side data queries for transforming
                    data returned by RESTful Web API endpoints, using a URL
                    scheme similar to ODATA. The API provided the ability to
                    express filtering, paging, sorting, grouping, and
                    aggregation of data. The fluent API signature was similar to
                    .NET&apos;s LINQ, but callable from TypeScript/JavaScript.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Helped to establish more advanced features of back-end Web
                    API model bindings to parse and apply queries built by the
                    aforementioned front-end API.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented front-end unit tests using Gulp, Jasmine, Karma,
                    Angular CLI, and Angular Testing Framework.

                <h4>Role: AppDev Team - Full-stack Software Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                  Used Advanced JavaScript techniques and popular web frameworks
                  and technologies, such as Angular, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC,
                  and Entity Framework to update, enhance, and add features to
                  existing Reporting Studio web application. Reporting Studio
                  was designed to provide retail reporting and analytics for our
                  clients - vendors to Walmart, Target, and other prominent
                  brick and mortar retailers.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented a dashboard presentation framework
                    to help curate and categorize existing reports and content,
                    making them easier to find. The framework was highly
                    extensible and scalable, facilitating rapid implementation
                    and deployment of new types of content.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added functionality to facilitate multiple design surfaces
                    in the AdHoc Report Designer which provided a user friendly
                    way to express advanced dynamic filtering, to be used as a
                    prefilter for the primary data-set produced by the report
                    design on the main surface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added new AdHoc Basic mode, a trimmed down version of the
                    original AdHoc Report Designer. This resulted in increased
                    adoption of that tool by existing clients and increased
                    sales to new clients. The basic mode served as a general
                    purpose report designer and as a segue to the original
                    advanced designer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented C# scripting engine and API to provide, with
                    just a few clicks, advanced retailer-specific filtering
                    concepts like “traited vs valid” via the AdHoc Basic mode.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Employed the module pattern to strengthen the architecture
                    of the AdHoc Report Designer, a user-friendly web-based
                    drag-and-drop reporting design tool.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed advanced map plotting feature for visualizing data
                    points geographically. It supported multiple map browser
                    windows to which data points could be plotted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Helped transition front-end JavaScript codebase to
                    TypeScript.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented front-end build processes (using gulp and
                    node.js), including generation of client-side entities and
                    DTOs to be used for interop with Web APIs.

                    Designed and implemented online testing web application
                    using ASP.NET Web APIs and an HTML/JavaScript front-end,
                    involving Knockout.js and MVVM pattern. The application
                    allowed the user to login to their test and navigate from
                    question to question, selecting answers which were recorded
                    on the server and instantly scored when the user finished
                    the test. Involved heavy use of Knockout.js and the template
                    binding, as well as cross-browser display of MathML content
                    that was embedded in the questions&apos; XHTML. Upon last
                    check, it was found to have collected results for over 5
                    million tests from over 140 districts.

                    for data-driven bundling, minification, and dynamic loading
                    of application resources, including JavaScript modules, HTML
                    templates, and CSS stylesheets. The resources were grouped
                    into “resource maps”, which could be referenced by
                    JavaScript modules in a way that insured required resources
                    were loaded before the module&apos;s code was executed,
                    somewhat like require.js, but more comprehensive and
                    designed to work more seamlessly with the Microsoft Web

                    presentation of new versions of legacy applications built
                    with new stack. The portal included a data-driven home page
                    that displayed an icon for launching all of the applications
                    to which the user had access.

                    data-bound front-end presentation components.{' '}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One such component was a client-side datagrid that allowed
                    user to dynamically sort by column(s) and directions of
                    their choosing, and filter by columns as well. The grid used
                    breeze.js to assemble OData queries on the client side,
                    submit them to ASP.NET Web API controllers, and finally
                    receive the results and display them via the Knockout.js
                    templating system. It also allowed custom display and
                    formatting of column data, using JS callbacks and option
                    object conventions. The grid was expandable, allowing custom
                    column templates to be specified via the grid&apos;s
                    options. The grid was very flexible and could handle a
                    variety of development scenarios.

                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented a unified data-bound list component
                    with two display modes: a dropdown list and a static
                    listbox. This component displayed a list of items and
                    allowed selection of either a single item or multiple items,
                    depending on the options specified by the developer. Options
                    for this component also included the ability to specify the
                    fields to be used for binding display text and selected
                    value(s).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented new multi-layered authentication and
                    authorization system based on ASP.NET Identity Framework,
                    which checked for authorization at the district, school, and
                    user levels.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented applications that facilitated
                    management of district, school, and user access to
                    application features and historical data. The application
                    was used by internal staff, as well as manager users from
                    client districts, to authorize access to services and
                    resources.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Established new schema for storing multiple frameworks of
                    educational standards, spanning multiple subjects. The
                    schema was designed in a way that would allow attributes and
                    their values to be dynamically associated to a set of
                    standards within a framework/subject grouping without
                    changes being made to the schema.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented application for entry and
                    management of educational standard frameworks and their
                    standards and groupings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented application for entry and
                    management of course alignment data, including associations
                    to educational standards, definition of curriculum schedule
                    by marking periods, and management of rule-based course
                    settings and limitations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented third version of content management
                    and editor web application on new stack. Implementation
                    included integration with ckEditor, a JavaScript based,
                    client-side open source rich content editor component, to
                    replace EditLive! Java applet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Designed and implemented a unified, rule-based assessment
                    compilation and rendering framework, which facilitated the
                    delivery of assessments via multiple formats, including PDF
                    for print format, and via new version of in-house online
                    testing platform (updated for use with the new platform and
                    stack). Implementation of PDF formatting service included
                    invoking of the now separated Razor templating and
                    data-binding engine from ASP.NET MVC to produce an HTML
                    document that, along with a CSS3 stylesheet, was converted
                    to a PDF file.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rebuilt online testing platform on new stack, and integrated
                    it into content management and editor application, to allow
                    content editor users to preview assessment questions in
                    online format and approve them for online test taking.
